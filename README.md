# Sim Game

Six dots (vertices) are drawn. Each dot is connected to every other dot by a line (edge).

Two players take turns coloring any uncolored lines. One player colors in one color, and the other colors in another color, with each player trying to avoid the creation of a triangle made solely of their color (only triangles with the dots as all corners count; intersections of lines are not relevant); the player who completes such a triangle loses immediately.
